# Studying-GDPR-and-Classifying-it-into-Privacy-Requirements-with-NLP-Machine-Learning-and-BERT


This Project deals with data privacy, legal compliance, machine learning, and advanced language models such as BERT. It explores the complex realm of data privacy and protection, specifically emphasizing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In our interconnected digital era, where data flows freely, these subjects gain significant relevance due to mounting concerns about individual privacy and data security. The use of advanced language models such as BERT and GPT highlights the importance of this study in utilizing cutting-edge technology for legal categorization tasks in the context of GDPR compliance.
The problem addressed in this Project is the appropriate classification of GDPR into privacy obligations. This is critical since GDPR is a complex and comprehensive regulatory framework, making manual categorization time-consuming and prone to mistakes. The ever-increasing number of legal texts and the pressing need for GDPR compliance make accurate and automatic classification of these laws a vital concern.  Machine learning, BERT, and natural language processing techniques provide a viable approach for efficiently automating this procedure. The significance derives from the necessity for organizations to comply with GDPR legislation, which necessitates a reliable approach to detecting and executing privacy obligations.
The study adopts a rigorous and systematic approach, combining machine learning methodology with natural language processing tools. It thoroughly assesses several feature representation approaches, such as Count Vectorization and TF-IDF Vectorization, which are then combined with a variety of machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Logistic regression, and advanced language models such as BERT and GPT. Extensive evaluations, k-fold cross-validation, and rigorous data preparation assure the findings' robustness and reliability.
The Project's main contribution is the finding that,
1. Count Vectorization consistently outperforms competing techniques in categorizing GDPR law into privacy requirements when paired with the Decision Tree model. 
2. Standard machine learning algorithms have been proven to outperform BERT, emphasizing the findings' practical value.

This study has significant implications for enterprises and organizations attempting to address the complicated issues of GDPR compliance, providing them with a powerful tool to easily traverse the complex regulatory landscape. Furthermore, the study sheds light on the subtle advantages and disadvantages of sophisticated language models such as BERT when compared to classic machine learning approaches. This comparative research gives useful insights for future privacy compliance and legal automation endeavors.
